# Puzzle League
Demo of Pok√©mon Puzzle League

This is a simple color matching game built using the Python library Pygame. In this game, your objective is to match three or more blocks of the same color in a row or column to clear them from the board. Chain reactions due to gravity can occur. In this demo, we have initialized with a puzzle (that apparently you can solve in 2 moves), but you can add your own puzzle if you want.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the cursor around the grid.
- Press the Enter key to swap the block within the cursor.
- Match three or more blocks of the same color in a row or column to clear them from the board.
- Clearing blocks triggers chain reactions, allowing for strategic gameplay.
- The game ends when there are no more moves available.
